    <h3>Personal information:</h3>
    <p>My name is Ekaterina Galant but I go by Kate. I am currently a third year student at
       Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Business Administration with a 
       concentration in Finance. Throughout my college career I was able to take Investments,
        Management Information Systems, Computational Methods in Finance, Database Design, 
        DataScience, and other relevant courses that helped me shape a good understanding of
        the Finance Field and pick up several coding languages. My previous coop was at Brown 
        Brothers Harriman as Investment Operations coop, where I has an individual machine 
         learning project that required data gathering with SQL and Python, data analysis and
          predictive algorithms for a product that is utilized to transmit corporate action, 
          trade and other messages through SWIFT, MQ, Fax and other transport. I am interested 
          in working in Finance incorporating Data Analysis and Analytical platforms for process 
          improvement, I am particularly interested in Financial and Business Analytics, Quantitative 
          analysis, and Consulting. </p>
