    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>This page is meant to raise awareness of the healthier choices people can make daily and the benefits that come along with those choices. 
      The short-term decisions that come across our lives have an enormous impact on the environment as well as our own wellbeing. 
    Small changes like eating few beans and nuts every day can increase longevity giving up to 4 years of life. That is why health has to be looked at at a different angle, 
    without body image concerns, short term gratification with processed foods & exercise options based on popularity. </p>
